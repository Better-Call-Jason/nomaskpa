        "comments" => "This is the very first document and the source of every claim, fact and rumor about the pandemic known as Covid-19. From just a cursory glance, it appears that  a larger timeline is being created out of thin air on New Years Eve.  This document behaves like a wire service report or an RSS feed of communications between health care professionals. It seems that whatever is written in this document is accepted as fact. There is a persistent anomaly nagging at me though. If this document was written on 12-30-2019. How does it reference posts from 12-31-2019, the next day? <br><br>
                                The document wants to create a panic by insisting that there is nothing to panic about. We are having an emergency symposium but don't worry we've got this under control. We will see this type of reverse psychology used multiple times in the development of the official narrative that lead to universal masking and global lock downs.<br><br>
                                Let's do the math. There are 4 people who are sick. Why, then is it something of concern? It is stated that :  the first patient simply appeared at the seafood market. I am not certain why that fact was so immediately important unless what we are looking at is the development of a narrative blaming an animal to human sickness as the root cause. What do they mean he appeared? Apeared, what..out of thin air, like magic?<br><br>
                                In the next few lines the cases go up from 4 to 27. 7 are seriously ill. But, 2 are recovering and likely to be discharged. If those two are from the 7 that were really sick, then there are only 5 that are very ill. In a city of 11 million, in the height of winter, and in a city with poisonous open-air garbage incineration taking place very close to residences, I am not sure how 5 serious cases of pneumonia warranted even a comment. How would so few cases of a normal ailment be significant enough to cause anyone to be alarmed?<br><br>
                                It seems to be clear that this document is the original formation of the narrative and many other studies and experiments will reference it repeatedly as the source of evident facts. However its veracity is very much in question. The hospitals aren't named. The patients aren't named. This type of anonymity is done to protect the privacy of the individuals. But, why not name the hospitals? Then at the very minimum a reporter or investigator could verify that the hospital did have a case of bizarre pneumonia and prove that the details were accurate. The emergency symposium had to take place somewhere. There had to be hospitals coordinating the event. Why would they leave out all of the specifics of a very important event handling a bizarre pneumonia at a specific set of hospitals? The vagueness of the descriptions makes certain that there is no further questioning beyond the statements provided here. This is the starting document and nothing comes before it. But, it reads more like a fictional narrative of talking points more than anything else. It occurs to me that this document may not be based in reality. The entire pandemic may be completely fictional not unlike the one in a Leigh Nichols novel written in 1981. </i>"

To make the narrative elongate, they titrated in a few extra weeks by claiming without fact that the earliest onset time was December 12, 2019. The state-controlled news article reads similarly to the ProMED Mail Post seen above but with much more authority. <br><br>
It instructs the citizens on how they are to behave. The article claims that there are only 7 very ill. Why are they making a big deal about this? The last paragraph reminds us that they were already in a season that has a high incidence of infectious diseases. How were these 59 cases and 7 very ill patients differentiated from the fugue? How were they able to determine in a matter of days without research or experimentation that SARS and MERS were excluded? How did they tell the difference with the exact same symptoms?<br><br>
 At this point, 6 days in, they state that no medical personal have been infected and that no clear evidence of human to human transmission has been observed. How are earth was this even newsworthy then? This does not appear to be about conveying the news but continuing to build a narrative that can show what they are going to do.<br><br>
  Paragraph three talks about closing the South China Seafood City to clean and disinfect for 59 people with pneumonia but only 7 who are very ill and none have died in a city of 11 million. It seems impossible that a city would take those measures for just a few sick people without any verifiable proof that they all got sick at the market or even a known cause. Wuhan is a city with poisoned air from the operation of open-air-garbage-incineration plants right next to residences. Why wasn't that fact even considered as a cause of the respiratory problems? Why did no one in the American press talk about that as a potential cause. Why the rush to identify a new pathogen? Well we all know why...right?  In early March of 2020, we all know that in our areas far from Wuhan, 1 case was observed in a prominent person that interacts with a lot of the public and had just returned from Asia. Then all businesses started to close to disinfect. Then we were all required to wear masks while the endless pandemic ensued, schools and restaurants were shuddered and life as we knew it ended. This shows the power of the induction of fear to bewitch an apparently free society into abject slavery over 7 people who were mysteriously sick in a city of poisoned air and 11 million souls. Are we living in a direct to dvd dystopian movie?  "

        "comments" => "In this article, we began to see the narrative crumbling. As the narrative crumbles, classic Orwellian doublespeak is utilized to overcome the cognitive dissonance and ensure a continuance and escalation of the unfounded fears and over-reactions. The claim that there is global attention focused on Wuhan is circular and directly attributed to speculative claims made by the ProMED Mail Posts. In the second column, a general overview of the facts ensues. This outbreak as they are referring  to it affects just 41 people. One person has died. But that one death is very likely due to complications of liver failure. 8 people have been discharged. 7 appear to be critical. With only one suspect death, the rest recovering and only a few undergoing serious treatment, why is this considered to be an outbreak? <br><br>

Looking at the symptom percentages in this article, the largest percentage of the 41 patients have a fever and a dry cough. Only 8 of the 41 or 20 % of the patients have any respiratory (breathing) problems. That amount likely includes the person who died not from Covid-19 but from liver failure. That means seven people are having breathing problems and/or respiratory difficulties. Those must be our remaining 7 critical patients. What they have done is split respiratory complaints into two very similar categories for the point of making the respiratory problems appear much larger than they are in reality. This is a practice being utilized to this very moment with exaggerating cases and symptoms. <br><br>

Of the 41 patients, 1 died, 7 remain critical and 8 were discharged. This means that the remaining 25 other patients have only minor symptoms according to the symptoms percentage numbers. Those are a fever, aches and pains, and a cough. According to the article there hasn't been a new case in 10 days. Why does the article not come at this perceived outbreak by asking is it really an outbreak? Why is there no skepticism in their analysis and inquiry. Why not claim they are over-reacting to something that is statistically insignificant?<br><br>

The authors state that they have no conflicts of interest. But, before that meaningless required statement, they list a plethora of conflicts of interest. First, these are research scientists that work for very official sounding private companies like the Centers for Disease Control. They are paid by government grants awarded to perform research and experiments when it is deemed necessary to solve a problem. This article is written by people who have a <i>specialist interest</i> in emerging and re-emerging pathogens. That is scientific jargon for: <b>this is how we pay the bills</b>.<br><br>

Therefore no sensible person that has carefully reviewed the article and relevant facts would take this article to be anything more than a grant-seeking article from those who benefit from receiving grants. This is why they are scaring the public into thinking there is a serious outbreak despite the facts to the contrary. How can we expect scientists that directly benefit from pathogen identification to be entirely objective. It is a myth and easily destroyed by a careful read of the complete article. This article will also be cited multiple times which further exacerbates the depletion of verifiable data. It also concentrates the unjustified fear until by March of 2020 they will have created a perfect imaginary storm fashioned entirely out of thin air. They create a pretend disease, create a pretend test, and then a pretend treatment and a pretend vaccine. None of it is real. The emperor truly has no clothes.

It was a table top exercise that reviewed what the medical authorities with the help of governments and large pharmaceutical corporations could do if a major pandemic was underway. That event was called Event 201. Now on 1-19-20, they announce by press release fiat that there are now 201 <b>cases</b>.<br><br>
 
 This article is from the Chinese CDC and does not cite a source for the 201 cases. It does not say that they are hospitalized, sick or what symptoms they have or where they are being treated. If we accept that the 201 cases includes the 41 cases from the previous articles and citations, then there have been a fourfold increase in less than 10 days. It would seem that fact would be significant in the monitoring of a real outbreak. 
 <br><br>
 But there is not a single news story from January 10th - January 20th that reviews this mega increase in cases and shows the incremental nature of the change. All the sudden on the January 19th, we have 201 total cases. But, other sources seem to dispute that.  This leads me to think that the new cases could be entirely fiction. These new cases could be created out of thin air to bolster the idea that a real pandemic is emerging despite evidence to the contrary. It could also be the quintessential start of the live version of event 201 with the iconic 201 cases created out of thin air. Who knows? "
