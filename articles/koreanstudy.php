                <p class="lead">Let's begin with this lovely bit of CGI. Most of the world thinks these are real pictures of the virus. That statement is easily proven. Just take these pictures into a Wal-Mart and start asking people what they are. What this shows is the level of ignorance and unknowing at work in a world of 7 billion souls. With all of this knowledge, we are sadly in the worst mental decline in at least a 100 years. It also shows the power of an image, real or imagined to transfix and bewitch the entire earth. </p>
                <p class="lead"> Other more intelligent individuals appear to understand the science behind electron microscopy. They will realize these  images are an artistic interpretation. Though, even they will likely believe it is based in fact. They will assert that the virus is most certainly proven to be an infectious pathogenic contagion understood via the scientific method. They would think a person to be crazy if one was to consider anything otherwise. Well, let's do something crazy.</p>

                <h2 class="featurette-heading">A Global Empire :<span class="text-muted"> Allopathic Medical Fascism is a Stateless Monster Destroying Health and Wellness Worldwide</span></h2>
                <br>
                <p class="lead">The experiment and research we are discussing in this article are from the origination paper and the South Korean study. It is an experiment from the South Korean Centers For Disease Control based on a patient that had recently traveled to Wuhan China. It was conducted in a top secret militarized laboratory to ensure no pesky spectators or reporters questioning the claims being made. The practices in South Korea are the same as in the U.S. and in China and in Europe. The allopathic medical fascists do not care who the president is in the U.S. Much of the data being relied on comes from a handful of people that got sick in Wuhan, China. Though the current U.S. president is belligerent towards China, our medical fascists accept the proof of contagion, epidemiology or proof that it is a disease that is transmissible between humans to be proven by citing Chinese studies. These cited studies contain very little proof of anything as we will see. The Korean study we are unpacking cites numerous recent Chinese papers too. </p>
                <p class="lead"> Wuhan, with a population of 11 million is a heavily poisoned city with open-to-the-air garbage incineration very near to where people live. In the summer of 2019, nearly ten thousand residents of Wuhan were protesting in the streets. They were angry and concerned about the poisoned air they were being forced to breathe. The incinerators were located near residential areas of the town. Get this big picture of what was going on then by reading <a href="../assets/koreanstudy/docs/chinadigitaltimes_net_2019_07_thousands_in_wuhan_protest_aga.pdf" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none"> this article</a>. It doesn't take too much thought to consider that maybe the outbreak of sickness was not due to a new contagion but rather due to a sick and poisoned environment. Why is it that the scientists don't even consider the evidence of mass sickness via the mechanism of poisoned air? That would require them to begin advocating for health and wellness and that is something they simply cannot do. </p>
                <p class="lead">Their entire method operates on making sure people stay sick and have no one to turn to but them. If they admit that pollution or poisoned air is the cause then they would have to advise governments to make changes to clean the air. That would lead to less sick people. But their entire method requires continual sickness and ill-health. The scientific medical elite pay their mortgages and fill their gas tanks by being paid through grants to research the causes of sickness. The entire system requires the continual generation of new and novel diseases that no one understands and nothing but their concoctions can cure. </p>
                <p class="lead">It is fascism in the truest sense of the word. I don't use the phrase medical fascists as an attack. I assert it as a statement of fact that can be proven by a careful review of their actions, behaviors and policies. I understand that most people working for that system entered it and continue to operate in it with the belief that they are doing something good for humanity. I don't want to demonize those people who are operating in good faith, raising families, and doing their best to survive as well. I want to expose the deception at work even within their well intentioned ideas that ensures a perpetual endlessly sick global society. </p>
                <p class="lead"> I want to be absolutely clear on this one. Yes, they are medical fascists. And, yes, I am fighting them because I see that they are destroying everything including themselves in a process that most of them do not understand. But, they are not evil people. They are misguided as I have been many times througout my life. We win this war against the destruction of our health by winning the argument and restoring the world to health and wellness through sanity. We cannot win by creating yet another divide and conquer scenario. I must say this, because in 2020, in the US, there is a great crisis of <i>otherization</i>.</p>
                <p class="lead">I do not want this work to be construed as demonizing the scientists as being evil people. I am attacking their methods and results not them as individuals. I am attacking the idea of allopathy supported by police power not with a sword but with a better idea. We can have wellness and health based on an accurate understanding of what makes us sick and what we can do to heal the body. We could have a system based on wellness today if only we would abandon the myth that modern medicine with its coercive police power is above corruption and reproach. It isn't. We must demolish that myth if we are going to survive. These opening remarks are paramount to understanding anything I will present in this investigation. Let the doctors that genuinely care about healing the broken, the poor and the sick rise in prominence as that old poisoned system built on a myth falls. Let doctors like the great Tom Cowan rise up to heal a broken and sick world restoring it to health and wellness through accurate science and true medical knowledge. Dr Cowan is now retired but has written some amazing books explaining how to heal the body and live in wellness. His current work is focused on unraveling the myth of contagion. Even though it is yet to be released it is already facing suppression. I have been deeply impacted by his work. I am certain you will be too. </p>

                <br><p class="lead">Certainly, they used human cells to test for and isolate the Covid-19 virus in their defining experiment, right? Actually, no, they did not. They used replicated cells from an African Green Monkey's kidney. The monkey apparently was alive around 1962. See the Wikipedia blurb. </p>
                <p class="lead"> The cells that were used in this experiment were a special type of protector cell from the African Green Monkey's kidney called epithelial cells. These cells are part of the outer defense of organs like the kidneys and may be more active in defense of the organism. These cells may have a heightened reaction to being invaded and may behave differently than the other three basic types of a cell. It is interesting that the scientists chose this type of cell to culture alone and did not find the need to test their theory out on other types of cells or other types of organs. It is also interesting that they chose to do this experiment on non-human cells exclusively. How do we know that the monkey kidney protective cells (replicated from a monkey that was alive in 1962 and existing now only in a culture for this experiment) will behave 100% the same as live human cells do today? We don't. But that didn't seem to matter. It also doesn't even receive an honorable mention in the paper. They entirely omitted the fact that they could infect a monkey's cells with a suspected human pathogen. It doesn't appear that anyone even noticed or cared about this huge oversight and misapplication of the results. A final note about this type of cell from the monkey. They are called <i>Vero Cells</i>. It is interesting that the word <i>Vero</i>  means truth in the Polish, Esperanto language. This experiment is so far from the truth, I found that anecdote to be that quite amusing. </p>

                <br>
                <p class="lead">Each of the following chapters will discuss a single part of experiment and point of inconsistencies that are often hidden by clever jargon, obfuscation and conflation. Obfuscation is the practice of making things difficult to understand by the use of confusing or ambiguous language. Conflation is the merger of multiple different and often oposing ideas into one. These three together make it almost impossible to understand the very simple things that are being done in this experiment.</p><br>
                <p class="lead"> It is my goal in this investigation to make every part of this experiment understandable with simple language and explanations about what is taking place </p><br>
                <p class="lead">This first section is an easy one. The premise is that the sick patient that had recently been to Wuhan is contacted by medical scientists and agrees to be studied via this experiment. A medical professional inserts a mspecial q-tip into the nose and scrapes some cells from the patient. They want to determine if the patient's sickness is caused by something that is able to be isolated, and is measurable, visible and transmissible from the swab. They are looking for a contagion. The swab goes directly into a a vial containing viral transport media. </p><br>
                <p class="lead">This is a very important first stop point to critique the method utilized. The process begins with adulteration. Let me explain. They want to determine if something can be isolated from the swabbed material. They want to prove that the isolated substance is the cause of the sickness. But, their method starts with adulterating the very material they will later say that they have isolated. Throughout this investigation we be critical of every time that dilute and adulterate the very material they are claiming to isolate.</p>
