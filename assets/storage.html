        <h2>The Experiment</h2>
        <p style="text-transform: capitalize">We are designing an experiment that will determine the level of oxygen within the masked area of the face available to breathe while wearing a mask. We will also seek to determine the amount of oxygen in the blood during prolonged mask wearing. Finally we will assess how all of this affects cognition in prolonged mask wearing events. </p>

    <h2>The Numbers</h2>
    <p style="text-transform: capitalize">The death numbers have been exaggerated to induce fear and panic. In reality, The death rate in PA is 0.00063%. That is 6.3 ten thousandths of one percent. For those under 60, the death rate percentage is less than 1/2 of 1 millionth of one percent or 0.0000432%. With such small numbers, can this still be called a pandemic?</p>

    <h2>The Test </h2>
    <p style="text-transform: capitalize">The RT-PCR test does not test for a virus but for a fragment of RNA of unknown origin that is said to cause cell damage. This particular method is problematic and reliant on bias and assumption. Even the medical professionals don't take it seriously. This is why they are instructed to diagnose by symptoms. </p>

        <p style="text-transform: capitalize">The governments, pharmaceutical world, and academics, have been planning today for decades. Why? Because it further consolidates power and control. They created fear and panic and then forced us all to wear masks. We are now living in the most bizarre superstitious ritual ever experienced by human beings. But does the scientific data show that masks really work?</p>

    <h2>Medical Quackery </h2>
    <p style="text-transform: capitalize"> The myth that breathing through homemade masks is safe and effective is laughable These homemade masks will not protect you from a virus and could cause serious breathing issues. See this poorly designed experiment that is visibly torturing it's victims, err, participants. You'll be shocked at the lengths they with go. </p>

<p class="lead">Ok, so what should the test look like. Well let's consider what we would need to figure out. First, if we are going with the contagion theory that is to say that something real, isolatable and measurable is making you sick, we would want to isolate it and examine it. Scientist have a tool to do just that. It is called a microscope. But in this case, an electron microscope would be necessary. Those are very expensive and so a sample would need to be sent to a research institution to perform the analysis of the sample. A doctor would carefully swab your throat or nasal passage. Then, seal up the sample in preservation liquid and freeze and ship overnight to the electron microscope lab. The lab would prepare the sample and image it with the electron microscope. Then the imaged result would be compared with the known pathogen and a diagnosis could be performed based on the resolved images of the electron microscope. An electron microscope is able to resolve particles to the size of 0.2nm. The virus that is said to cause Coronavirus disease is between 90 and 125 nm. This means that the electron microscope should have no trouble resolving the virus and imaging it directly. We are shown the computer generated planet-like orbs to be the actual virus. We see this dangerous and ominious looking orbs on every website and news platform. I did find one study that appears to follow this method. Although on further analysis, it uses circular reasoning and flawed logic to claim that the isolated material is pathogenic. It then uses the same old RT-PCR test to confirm the presence of the replicated virus. As stated before the RT-PCR test cannot prove the presence of a virus. </p>
<p class="lead">In section 3 of the study called Virus Isolation, it discusses the methodology used and gives a window into the deception. You would think that they actually isolated the virus. But that is not the case. In their own words : <i>"Virus replication and isolation were confirmed through cytopathic effects, gene detection, and electron microscopy"</i> This statement means that they injected the non-isolated material into a living cell culture and noticed that the cells within the culture died. They then blamed the cell death  on the virus that wasn't isolated before injection. And, in the injection along with the non-isolated viral material was antibiotics (which are known to kill cells) and fetal bovine serum. Now, I am just guessing here but maybe the antibiotics or the fetal bovine serum killed the cells in the culture. And, that it had nothing to do with a suspected yet not isolated virus. That could be proven by simply injecting the cells with the other stuff as a control. But it doesn't appear that was done. Then, as if that wasn't bad enough, they extract some of the material from the culture of cells that they just killed by injection. Then they run a RT-PCR test on it. And, no suprise at all, the material is proven to be the virus. But, we all know that the RT-PCR test doesn't prove the existence of a virus. It can't and it never will. Well that is what it's inventor said. Next, they take this amplified, simulated mixture and put it under the electron microscope where weird looking orbs appear. These orbs are called the virus and now we have a pathogen. Case closed. Or is it. I want to know why didn't they start with the electron microscope. Why didn't they take the sample minus the extra stuff like bovine serum and antibiotics and image that with the electron microscope. Aren't we concerned about finding out what is actually going on in the body. This study is cited at proof that the virus exists but it is based on circular reasoning, flawwed logic and the poisoning of a cell culture by foreign material. It never shows proof that the virus is isolated. Read the study for yourself. Learn about the deception and free yourself from fear. </p>
